# ترجمه فارسی بیانیه گنو GNU


## Abstract

The GNU Manifesto is a call-to-action by Richard Stallman encouraging participation and support of the GNU Project's goal in developing the GNU free computer operating system. The GNU Manifesto was published in March 1985 in Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools. It is held in high regard within the free software movement as a fundamental philosophical source.
The full text is included with GNU software such as Emacs, and is publicly available.

## چکیده

بیانیه گنو (به انگلیسی: GNU Manifesto) در مارس ۱۹۸۵ توسط ریچارد استالمن نوشته شد و در ژورنال ابزارهای نرم‌افزاری دکتر داب به چاپ رسید تا توضیح و تعریف پروژه گنو را ارائه دهد و دعوت به همکاری و پشتیبانی کند. این بیانیه در جنبش نرم‌افزار آزاد با احترام زیاد نگه‌داری می‌شود و یک منبع فلسفی بنیادی است. متن کامل آن در نرم‌افزارهای گنو مثل ایمکس گنجانده شده‌است و از طریق وب نیز در دسترس است.

## GNU Manifesto (English)

_The GNU Manifesto (which appears below) was written by [Richard Stallman](https://www.stallman.org/) in 1985 to ask for support in developing the GNU operating system. Part of the text was taken from the original announcement of 1983. Through 1987, it was updated in minor ways to account for developments; since then, it seems best to leave it unchanged._

_Since that time, we have learned about certain common misunderstandings that different wording could help avoid. Footnotes added since 1993 help clarify these points._

_If you want to install the GNU/Linux system, we recommend you use one of the [100% free software GNU/Linux distributions](https://www.gnu.org/distros). For how to contribute, see [gnu.org/help](https://www.gnu.org/help/help.html)._

_The GNU Project is part of the Free Software Movement, a campaign for [freedom for users of software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). It is a mistake to associate GNU with the term “open source”—that term was coined in 1998 by people who disagree with the Free Software Movement's ethical values. They use it to promote an [amoral approach](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html) to the same field._

### What's GNU? Gnu's Not Unix!

GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it [1]. Several other volunteers are helping me. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.

So far we have an Emacs text editor with Lisp for writing editor commands, a source level debugger, a yacc-compatible parser generator, a linker, and around 35 utilities. A shell (command interpreter) is nearly completed. A new portable optimizing C compiler has compiled itself and may be released this year. An initial kernel exists but many more features are needed to emulate Unix. When the kernel and compiler are finished, it will be possible to distribute a GNU system suitable for program development. We will use TeX as our text formatter, but an nroff is being worked on. We will use the free, portable X Window System as well. After this we will add a portable Common Lisp, an Empire game, a spreadsheet, and hundreds of other things, plus online documentation. We hope to supply, eventually, everything useful that normally comes with a Unix system, and more.

GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix. We will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience with other operating systems. In particular, we plan to have longer file names, file version numbers, a crashproof file system, file name completion perhaps, terminal-independent display support, and perhaps eventually a Lisp-based window system through which several Lisp programs and ordinary Unix programs can share a screen. Both C and Lisp will be available as system programming languages. We will try to support UUCP, MIT Chaosnet, and Internet protocols for communication.

GNU is aimed initially at machines in the 68000/16000 class with virtual memory, because they are the easiest machines to make it run on. The extra effort to make it run on smaller machines will be left to someone who wants to use it on them.

To avoid horrible confusion, please pronounce the g in the word “GNU” when it is the name of this project.

### Why I Must Write GNU

I consider that the Golden Rule requires that if I like a program I must share it with other people who like it. Software sellers want to divide the users and conquer them, making each user agree not to share with others. I refuse to break solidarity with other users in this way. I cannot in good conscience sign a nondisclosure agreement or a software license agreement. For years I worked within the Artificial Intelligence Lab to resist such tendencies and other inhospitalities, but eventually they had gone too far: I could not remain in an institution where such things are done for me against my will.

So that I can continue to use computers without dishonor, I have decided to put together a sufficient body of free software so that I will be able to get along without any software that is not free. I have resigned from the AI Lab to deny MIT any legal excuse to prevent me from giving GNU away [2].
