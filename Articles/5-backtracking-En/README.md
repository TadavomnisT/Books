## Abstract

In this article, we discuss in detail a fundamental algorithm in artificial intelligence called backtracking and answer the following questions:

* What is the n-rooks (rook polynomial) problem?
* What is the n-queens problem?
* What is the backtracking algorithm?
* How can we solve the n-rooks problem using the backtracking approach?
* How can we solve the n-queens problem using the backtracking approach?
* How can we print an array as a tree structure in PHP?

## The n-Queens and n-Rooks Problem

One of the fundamental goals in artificial intelligence is to model our problems with mathematics and solve them using appropriate algorithms. Backtracking refers to a particular type of algorithm where we can find solutions to a mathematical problem by exploring and backtracking (undoing) steps. To explain this concept, I will use two well-known examples.

I propose two questions:
