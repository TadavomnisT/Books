= Comparison of RAM and HDD Read/Write Speeds =

== Abstract ==

This article provides a detailed comparison of the speed at which data is read and written on RAM and a hard disk drive (HDD). The underlying technology of both RAM and HDD is explained, followed by a comparison of their average read/write speeds considering technological complexities.

In this article, I will discuss in detail the speed of reading/writing data on RAM and on a hard disk drive (HDD). To do so, I will first explain the underlying technology of both RAM and HDD, and then compare their average read/write speeds due to technological complexities.

== Purpose of Comparing RAM and HDD Speed ==

RAM vs HDD

A few years ago, during a discussion on a programming forum, I mentioned that the average read/write speed of a hard disk drive is approximately 100,000 times slower than RAM. This statement seemed strange to many programmers, and not everyone accepted it. To justify my claim, I had to explain the technical aspects of RAM and HDD.

In this article, I will discuss why the average speed of a HDD is, on average, a hundred thousand times slower than RAM.

First of all, it is important to note that an accurate statement cannot be made regarding the speed comparison between HDD and RAM. Claiming that HDD is exactly that much slower than RAM shows a lack of understanding of the subject in a person.

Secondly, Comparing hard disk drives and RAM cannot be accomplished in a single article :) One can write a multi-volume book about RAM and another multi-volume book about HDD, and then compare them in a multi-volume book together! The depth of the subject is vast, and it extends beyond a simple comparison based on internet speed mentions.

It‚Äôs not as simple as saying, ‚ÄúHey, the internet states this HDD speed is X, and RAM speed is Y, so let‚Äôs just do the math and divide.‚Äù Nope, this topic is way more complex! It‚Äôs the kind of thing that could be explored in a doctoral thesis, with someone dedicating their entire PhD research to it and writing a lengthy paper. Yet, even then, the subject would still not be fully covered.

I said these stuff to highlight the complexity of the topic‚Ä¶ üò¨‚ù§Ô∏è Most of the information presented here regarding hard disk drives is sourced from Professor Abraham Silberschatz‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúDatabase System Concepts, 6th Edition.‚Äù

Now let‚Äôs move on to the main story.

== What is RAM? ==

RAM stands for Random Access Memory, which is a type of memory with random access. The name itself explains all the necessary information about RAM that we need to know. Imagine you have a large piece of memory that has relatively high speed (compared to technologies like disks and even things like EEPROMs) and its abstract representation is something like this:

''An Abstract RAM Model''

Imagine each cell as a byte. You can store information in a continuous sequence of n bytes with a decently fast speed. This level of speed allows the operating system to quickly store its current computation data (Look up for '''Memory address register''').

But why is it so fast?
