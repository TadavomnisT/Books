<b>What is Tadavomnism?</b><br/>
<br/>
Tadavomnism is a moral
philosophy based on everything or nothing! Simply, it means: There is
no consistency. A person who follows this philosophy is called
Tadavomnist. <br/>
The word &quot;Tadavomnism&quot; comes from a
Persian sentence : &quot;Tadavom nist.&quot; (<em>&quot;<font face="Tahoma"><span lang="fa-IR">تدا</em><em>و</em><em>م
نیست</em></span></font><em>.&quot; in Presian</em>) which means
&quot;There is no consistency&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Tadavomnism was
firstly introduced by Behrad.B who calls himself first Tadavomnist.
According to him, most of the people live this philosophy without
knowing it. Behrad.B once admitted that the song &quot;Talaagh&quot;
by Kamran Molaei was an inspiration for the name.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tadavomnism
Community&quot; is also the name of an organization founded by
Behrad.B in 2021 which is known to be a free independent
community-based organization, with open-source projects (<em>See URL
